    <h4>Target Users</h4>
    <p>For the first product launch, my target users were indiviudals aged between 18-30
      living around London, as the majority of the followers on the Complements Only instagram were in this
      demographic.
      All marketing was carried out via instagram, so I expected most users to shop using their mobile phones.

        <h4>Competitor Analysis </h4>
        <p>I identified key competitors within the industry, such as Carhartt and Stussy, and then compiled a table
          that outlined how, what and where information was displayed throughout their websites. I focused on the home
          page in particular. My key findings were:<br>
        </p>
        <ul class="blue">
          <li class="mt-1">
            <h6>

          <li class="mt-1">
            <h6>
              Cleanly designed websites, with lots of whitespace, were more compelling and satisfying to use.

          <li class="mt-1">

    <p>I questioned individuals within my target demographic, in order to understand their wants, needs and

        <h3> 3. Design </h3>
        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>I began by sketching wireframes on paper and then moved on to creating lo-fi digital
          wireframes* (see right) using the app Procreate.
          <br><br>
          On this project, I did not think it was necessary to create hi-fi wireframes,
          due to the fact I was working alone and the CMS enabled me to produce and edit live content very quickly.
          For examples of hi-fi wireframes and prototypes, which I have created using the tool 'Sketch' please see <a
            class="pointer"
            (click)="onClick('ice')">previous project. </a>
          <h4>Palette</h4>
          My designs and images to be used on the site were very colourful. So, I
          chose a neutral white-grey palette for the site.

    <h4>4. Build</h4>
    <p>I built the site over a few days using DotGo's website builder. I tested the site on different devices,
      used media queries and changed column ordering within the Bootstrap grid, to ensure the site was fully responsive.

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>I decided to test-launch the website first, offering a 10% discount to all users, in exchange for them
          providing
          me with feedback. I asked users about their journey through the website and to rank statements from 1-5, based
          on whether they "strongly agreed" or
          "strongly
          disagreed." <br>
          The statements included:
        </p>
        <ul class="light">
          <li class="light mt-1">
            "I had to search around the site for a while to get the information I wanted."

          </li>
          <li class="light mt-1">
            "I found the pictures in the Gallery page helpful in deciding what to order."

          </li>
          <li class="light mt-1">
            "After seeing the website, I changed my mind about what I wanted to buy."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h5>Results and Amendments</h5>
    <p>I was pleased that most users strongly agreed that information was easy to find, the site was easy to use
      and that the images used throughout the site supported the products. My key findings and actions taken were as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Key Finding:</b> Although most users agreed that the pictures in the Gallery made them <em>more </em> inclined to buy products and
        caused some to change their purchasing decisions, many users did not visit the Gallery
        during their journey through the website. <br>
         <b>Action:  <span class="blue">I included a link to the Gallery in the top
        navigation bar.</span></b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Key Finding:</b>  Although most users agreed that the environmental benefits of a made-to-order process made them more inclined to
        purchase
        products, many users failed to visit the About page before placing their order.<br>
         <b>Action:  <span class="blue"> I included additional links to the made to order section (using an anchor) of the About page from the Home page.
         </span></b>
        </li>
      <li>
        <b>Key Finding:</b> Some users
        highlighted that expected delivery times were not immediately clear.<br>
         <b>Action:  <span class="blue"> I clarified expected delivery times in the "made-to order" section and at the checkout.
         </span></b>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I plan to carry out further user testing and continually enhance and re-design the site, as and when I create further products.</p>
